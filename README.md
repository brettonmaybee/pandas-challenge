UCSD Data Science and Visualization: Assignment 3
This repository contains two pandas projects for analyzing csv data sets. 
  In the folder labeled **HeroesOfPymoli**, there is a pandas project named HerosOfPymoli_starter.ipynb. This project analyzes a csv file labeled purchase_data.csv located in the resources folder. The code analyzes purchase data from an independent fastasy game, and displays dataframes regarding gender demographics and purchasing analysis in regards to gender, age demographics, top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items. The file TESTPAD.ipynb, is an alternative workbook used while testing code for the HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb project.
  In the folder labeled **PyCitySchools**, there is a pandas project named PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb. This project is used to analyze school and student data csv files, located in the resources folder, and named schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv. This project is currently in progress. The file TESTPAD.ipynb, is an alternative workbook used while testing code for the HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb project.
